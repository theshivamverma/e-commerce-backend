### This repo is for the backend code of a e-commerce store built with MERN stack
[Frontend Repo Link](https://github.com/theshivamverma/e-commerce-app)
#### The backend code is written using ExpressJS, NodeJS and MongoDB

Features: 
    - Auth with jwt and token
    - encryption of password via bcrypt
    - user route 
    - cart route
    - wishlist route

USP: 
**User data is never being deleted from the backend**
**Once a item is being added to cart or wishlist it is being persisted there.** 
**For user it gets removed but the DB has it stored in invisible mode.**

PS: I am not willing to sell the user's data ðŸ˜‚
